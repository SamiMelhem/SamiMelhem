I'm a sophomore at Texas A&M University pursuing an internship in Data Analytics as a Computer Science Major. I've interned at INTERA Incorporated where I was a data software intern developing data-driven solutions for the water department. I'm also pursuing Google's Data Analytics Professional Certificate where I'm learning in-demand skills for pursuing a path in data analytics. I'm currently working on simple data science projects relating to Housing Prices Regression and Titanic Classification.
