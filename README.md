**Digital Craftsman (Developer/Musician/Health Enthusiast)**

I am a junior at Texas A&M University pursuing an internship in Data Science as a Computer Science Major. I have interned at INTERA Incorporated and Pivotal Research where I was a data science and data engineering interns (respectfully) that developed data-driven solutions for the water department of INTERA Incorporated, developed a carbon footprint tracker for INTERA Incorporated, and developed data/ML pipelines for clients under Pivotal Research. I am also pursuing Google's Data Analytics Professional Certificate where I am learning in-demand skills for pursuing a path in data analytics. I am currently working on data science and full stack coding projects.

          <summary><h3>üë®üèΩ‚Äçüè´ Sami's Coding Journey</h3></summary>
          I began my coding journey in high school, a period marked by curiosity and exploration. It was here, in the bustling corridors of learning, that I first encountered the world of programming. Java and Python were my initial guides, opening my eyes to the limitless possibilities that coding brings to the world. I applied my learning to my high school robotics team where I was a software lead leading our team to receiving 2nd place in the 6A UIL State competition. This foundational experience in high school laid the groundwork for my passion, shaping my understanding of the power and potential of technology.
          Carrying this enthusiasm with me, I embarked on my collegiate journey at Texas A&M University as a Computer Science student, eager to dive deeper into the complexities of this field. My focus soon shifted to Data Analytics, where I was captivated by the ability to translate vast datasets into meaningful insights. Currently I am apart of the Aggie Coding Club where I sharpen my coding skills, and the Aggie Data Science Club where I'm apart of a project called mrkts.expert, projecting market trends and learning how to understand chart patterns. These experiences have allowed me to blend theoretical knowledge with practical application.
          Now, as I navigate through my sophomore year, I'm reminded of the importance of stepping out of my comfort zone. The initial spark of fascination that was ignited in high school has now matured into a commitment to not only excel in data analytics but to also create impactful solutions. As I balance my academic responsibilities with personal development, I am setting in place strategies to channel more of my time and energy into bringing innovative ideas to fruition.
          Heading into the Spring 2024 semester, I am going to be joining the TAMU Robomasters organization as a software team member hoping to learn how to create autonomous robots and compete against teams from across the world. Additionally I will be joining a research team in the Computer Science department learning about how to implement newly founded data structures to improve fact checker performance.

### Recent Accomplishments
Alongside completing "Data Science Math Skills" from Duke University and "SQL for Data Science" from UC Davis, I've also successfully developed the TRVL website. This project represents a significant milestone in my web development journey, showcasing my skills in React, CSS, and JavaScript. It's a testament to my ability to create visually appealing and user-friendly interfaces, further solidifying my foundational understanding in both data science and web development.

### Current Learning Focus
Currently, I am apart of two Data Science Internships at INTERA Inc. and Pivotal Research Inc., along with being a software developer for Teamup. During this summer I am working on coding interview prep while also learning new technologies and methodologies.
